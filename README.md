# Design Society Student Chapter (DSSC) Website

### What is DSSC?
DSSC is the student chapter of the larger organization Design Society for the University of Texas at Dallas. Design Society is an association of individuals across the world who deepy care about design: How we create new artefacts and systems, how we think about this creation process, and what is the impact of human-created artefacts on the world we live in and on ourselves. DSSC presents opportunities for students to learn about design through hands-on activities, workshops, and socials.
